# ncaa-gymnastics-rank

## Project Description 
The project will be working with UF gymnastics in discovering a more fair national ranking system for the NCAA that we hope to present to the board to implement. The current system only factors in scores from the competitions. The top six scores, with at least 3 scores being "away", and the highest score being dropped, are then all averaged. The system they are hoping to create will use additional variables such as Win/Loss, strength of schedule, etc. The goal is to make this system more fair and comparable to other sports such as basketball and football.
